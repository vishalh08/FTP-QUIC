The Greywood Manor stood alone on the outskirts of the small, sleepy village of Eldenbrook, surrounded by dense forests that seemed to whisper secrets. The manor's stone walls had turned a muted shade of grey over the centuries, cloaked in ivy and shadowed by towering trees. Villagers often spoke of it in hushed tones, recalling tales of ghosts and mysterious lights that flickered in its windows at night.

Lily Hawthorne had always been drawn to the manor. As a child, she would ride her bicycle to the edge of the forest, peering through the tangled branches at the imposing structure. Her grandmother had told her stories of its former grandeur, of lavish parties and glittering chandeliers. But those days were long gone, replaced by an eerie silence that hung like a fog over the manor.
